# Todo_app

A simple todo app which can take any task from user and add it to its todo list and user can also delete its todo item.

Tech Used : 
ejs as a view engine 
nodejs for backend 
mongoDB for Database 

How to Run:
install all dependencies
run index.js file 

I was not able to add priority Features also I use MongoDB as database not postgresql.

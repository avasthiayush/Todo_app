# Todo_app

A simple todo app which can take any task from user and add it to its todo list and user can also delete its todo item.

Assumptions : -> User will enter a valid task of at least 1 character Length otherwise there will a default Task added.
           -> The entry ones deleted can't be recovered.

Approach : User will enter input from user interface page and we will store that input to database and show all tasks/entries in Last in first show order also task can be deleted from Interface page by just one click.

Tech Used : 
ejs as a view engine 
nodejs for backend 
mongoDB for Database 

How to Run:
install all dependencies
run index.js file 

I was not able to add priority Features also I use MongoDB as database not postgresql.
